#   About

### Overview
<p>
This static website was created using HTML, CSS, JS, and some Pypy.
It was meant for this Github static website hosting service.
It makes use of a Python script that is pretty robust but not yet OP,
but it works very well, and did not take much time.<br><br>

### Future Plans

**ELABORATION**

The plan as of now is to use this static website to run some JS-based apps we create.
It will also be used to advertise pictures of several other projects I create.<br>
In conclusion, this web site will be built upon in the coming future, God-given.<br><br>


<em>You're not alone?</em> Yes, It would be very arrogant to say that all I have done is by myself;
From my parents and teachers to my friends, I have been helped on every side, and loved.
It is this love that I've been nourished in that causes me to keep moving forward and grow.

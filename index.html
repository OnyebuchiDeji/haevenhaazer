<h3>HaEvenhaazer</h3>
<p>Welcome to my website, which is about me. I made this website to showcase some projects I have done, and to advertise my skills. There will be far more to come in the future. (This is Markdown btw).
<br><br></p>
<h3>About the Web Site</h3>
<p>Date of creation of this page: Wednesday 5th June 2024. This is the day I created this html generator from markdown in Python.
And finished making most of the app.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h3>What to Expect</h3>
<p>This is the kind of thing that is built upon, so its there's much to look forward to from now on.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
This static website was created using HTML, CSS, JS, and some Pypy.
It was meant for this Github static website hosting service.
It makes use of a Python script that is pretty robust but not yet OP,
but it works very well, and did not take much time.<br><br>

</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>
<p><strong>ELABORATION</strong></p>
<p>
    The plan as of now is to use this static website to run some JS-based apps we create.
    It will also be used to advertise pictures of several other projects I create.<br>
    In conclusion, this web site will be built upon in the coming future, God-given.<br><br>


    Why? Because I have more tham three energies flowing through my veins, and each one is OP.
    I also have plot armor.<br>
    If I told you, you won't believe me. But I'll show you.<br><br>

    You're not alone? Yes, I have a super power that transcends time -- my soul, my consciousness and all in it and yes, we work together.<br>
    Why're you writng all of this? Because at the moment of writing this, I feel so hyped that it's almost complete.

<h3>Elaboration</h3>
<p class="elaboration">
An OOP approach was used. A Cell and Effect class were made.
The Cell class was used to render a section of the image's pixels using some cool JS Canvas functions. This way, a grid of these cells was used to display the full image. Then the Effect class, which was used to make the grid was used to manipulate each pixel to cause some effect.
Then later, mouse position was gotten and used to manipulate the position of the pixels. This was used to create the effect.
Many kinds of effects were implemented -- some to spread out the pixels within the mouse's range, and another to draw them in like a sinkhole.
It inspired me to do the same thing with Python. It worked too!

<h3>Elaboration</h3>
<p class="elaboration">
It involved the use of Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy to produce the functionality of a cloud-oriented web app where every user has their own space and data on the app. The cliet's data is served to them by the server-side of the app, which is the same place where user authentication is done. Users can create as many accounts as they want and access the Note creating service. They can create notes, edit them, and delete them.
The UI provides responses that make interaction livelier, such as pop-up messages to show when a user has logged in or logged out, or when a note has been added.
Passwords and user information are stored securely on a database that contains hashed data so it cannot be read from the server-side. I use pbkdf2 hashing, which uses SHA-256 repeatedly, with salting, to make the hashing more secure.
<br>
From this project I became even better versed with the Flask module; I implement the use of blueprints to separate different functionality into their own separate server-side Python scripts; the Blueprints can have their own endpoints, and even their own url prefix or domain begore accessing their endpoints.
<br>
I also create the database models to represent a User and a Note object. SQLAlchemy makes querying easier and more robust, effectively preventing SQL injections because of how it queries the database using Python.

<h3>Briefing</h3>
<p class="briefing">
This is a web-based full-stack web application that completely separates the client-side from the server-side.
It is an app that simulates keeping track of information called 'Contacts'. Contacts' information consist of a First name, last name, and email.
This app demonstrates a scenario, for example, that companies use to keep track of employees.

<h3>Elaboration</h3>
<p class="elaboration">
    Unlike my previous projects that used the Flask API to modify the frontend before serving, this app demonstrates how the server-side is used strictly to receive requests, receive data and process it, and then serve it to frontend JavaScript, while the modifying of the information the client sees is done by the JavaScript.
    It uses NodeJS, hence the client-side is run from its own server entry point, while the server-side also has its own.
    Because the serve-side needs to communicate across the different domains, I disable the CORS restriction using the Python CORS module.
    This app enables one to add new Contacts, update them and delete them.

<h3>Elaboration</h3>
<p class="elaboration">
I did this to exactly replicate that done in Javascript.
It was more difficult as most of the funcitons provided by JS Canvas were not available in Pygame, so I had to create them myself.
It involved reading the pixels of the image after loading it, then determining the stride.
Then I folloqwed the OOP approavh of using a CELL class with a Pygame Surface object used to store pixels to be displayed on the screen.
The Cell class was used to render a section of the image's pixels using some cool JS Canvas functions. This way, a grid of these cells was used to display the full image. Then the Effect class, which was used to make the grid was used to manipulate each pixel to cause some effect.
Then later, mouse position was gotten and used to manipulate the position of the pixels. This was used to create the effect.

<h3>Elaboration</h3>
<p class="elaboration">
It involved the use of Flask, SocketIO, and random room code generation, to produce a  web app that is resembles popular learning interactive platforms such as Nearpod or Kahoot, requiring no password or authentication apart from your desired name and the room code to create it. Or to join an already existing room. This project gives more emphasis to the use of Flask SocketIO to enable live communication between clients, rather than full UI functionality.

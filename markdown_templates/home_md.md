Welcome to my website, which is about me. I made this website to showcase some projects I have done, and to advertise my skills. There will be far more to come in the future. (This is Markdown btw).

### About the Web Site

Date of creation of this page: Wednesday 5th June 2024. This is the day I created the html generator from markdown in Python and finished making most of the app.

This is however an intermediate site.

Soon, somewhere <b><em>here</b></em> will be a link to my actual Portfolio Website.

### What to Expect

This is the kind of thing that is built upon, so its there's much to look forward to from now on.

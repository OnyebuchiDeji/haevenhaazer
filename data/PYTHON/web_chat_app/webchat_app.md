### Elaboration
<p class="elaboration">
It involved the use of Flask, SocketIO, and random room code generation, to produce a  web app that is resembles popular learning interactive platforms such as Nearpod or Kahoot, requiring no password or authentication apart from your desired name and the room code to create it. Or to join an already existing room. This project gives more emphasis to the use of Flask SocketIO to enable live communication between clients, rather than full UI functionality.
